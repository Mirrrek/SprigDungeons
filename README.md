# Sprig Dungeons

A simple RPG powered by [Sprig](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig).

## Building

1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:Mirrrek/SprigDungeons.git && cd SprigDungeons
    ```
2. Install dependencies
    ```
    npm i
    ```
3. Build the project
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
4. Output is in the `dist` folder!

To run in watch mode (rebuild after any changes), run `npm run dev`.

Beware of the unorganized spaghetti code! I haven't planned this project out in advance too good.
